# civic-social
A website to track congressional politics in a user-friendly way. It uses the ProPublica API to pull in data updated in nearly real-time.

Right now, there are two user stories:

* You can see recent bills currently going through congress.
* You can find the social media handles for members of congress.
* More coming soon (including a map to search by district?!)
